# Python Side Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects completed during my learning and revision journey.  
Each project demonstrates different aspects of programming, from game development to data visualization and backend API design.

## Projects

### 1. Alien Invasion Game
- Based on the textbook *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes.  
- A 2D arcade-style game where the player controls a ship to shoot down alien fleets.  
- Demonstrates use of **Pygame**, object-oriented programming, and event-driven logic.  
- Features include player movement, bullet firing, alien fleet generation, and collision detection.

---

### 2. Data Visualization Activities
- A collection of scripts and notebooks exploring Python’s data visualization libraries.  
- Demonstrates use of **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, and **Pygal** for charts and interactive graphs.  
- Includes activities such as:
  - Line and scatter plots
  - Histograms
  - Random walk simulations
  - Dice roll probability visualizations

### 3. Task & Workflow Management API
- A RESTful API built with **Flask** and **SQLite** for managing tasks and workflows.  
- Features:
  - CRUD operations for tasks
  - Role-based access (Admin vs Worker)
  - Task assignment and status tracking (`Completed`, `Incomplete`, `In Progress`)
- Integrated **SQLAlchemy models** for persistent storage.  
- Endpoints include task creation, editing, deletion, assignment, and status updates.
